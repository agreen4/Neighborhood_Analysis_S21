# Working With Census Data

.pull-right[Planners work with Census data frequently, but it can be time consuming to download and manipulate.

[data.census.gov](data.census.gov) is the primary access point for Census data

The Census Bureau maintains an API (Application Programming Interface) from which we can request raw data from the Census servers

The `tidycensus` package is designed to make the requests on our behalf and to format the results.]

States, Counties, Places, and Tracts are the most common reference geographies for planners

States, counties, and tracts are hierarchical - states contain counties, and counties contain tracts.

Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) and Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZs) have more specialized applications
