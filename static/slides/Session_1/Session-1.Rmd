# Course Overview and Objectives

### - Together, we will learn techniques for analyzing the demographic, economic, physical, and social conditions that exist at the neighborhood scale
### - We will focus on the craft of translating multiple sources of information into stories that can be used to inform decision-making
### - We will focus on telling stories about the past, present, and future of neighborhoods
### - We will learn to work with many types of information, including census data, administrative data, and will collect some primary data

# By the end of this course, we will...

### 1.	Become familiar with common sources of information used to describe neighborhoods and neighborhood characteristics;
### 2.	Learn how to use R and RStudio in service of analyzing neighborhood-level information;
### 3.	Learn how to use the information to tell compelling stories for deliberation and decision-making;
### 4.	Apply these skills within our local context in Champaign.

# Learning R for Urban Planning

Wy would we want to make use of R as a tool for urban planning and analysis?

- R is **open source** and available at no cost
- R code is **scalable and reproducible** making it easy for others to reproduce our analysis given the same set of input data
- R is supported by a **diverse user community** that developes specialized applications for the R language
- R **connects** planning analysis to other forms of statistical analysis and data science

--
# Additional Rationales

- R forces us to learn the *nature* and *structure* of our data - this makes us **better consumers** of information
- R can help us to **integrate analyses** and streamline workflows, resulting in more efficient and effective work patterns

You will present an updated structure for neighborhood analysis based on feedback received for the previous assignment. Utilizing this structure, you will present a detailed analysis of neighborhood wellness for the city of Champaign, exploring the relative disparity in the wellness of neighborhoods across the city. You will also analyze what the variations in neighborhood level characteristics of wellness mean with respect to the socio-economic configuration of the neighborhoods themselves.

Utilizing your neighborhood wellness analyses, you will undertake a detailed physical needs assessment for the pilot neighborhood. You may utilize your own data analysis, interviews and field walks with institutional stakeholders, and independent field assessments as necessary. In addition, you may also identify other ‘non-physical’ needs at the neighborhood level by demonstrating how they may alter wellness in the neighborhood.

# Attendance and Participation
.pull-left[

- Full participation is expected for all course sessions - that means that you should have completed readings assigned for each session, and briefed yourself on in-class workbooks prior to our class time
- There is a 2 percent penalty for unexcused class absences
- Excused absences *may* be granted on a case-by-case basis, but must be approved prior to the absence

# Honor Code
The Illinois Student Code states: “It is the responsibility of the student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions.” Note that you are subject to the Honor Code, as well as procedures for addressing violations to the Code, regardless of whether you have read it and understand it. According to the Code, “ignorance is no excuse.”

- In written work, all ideas (as well as data or other information) that are not your own must be cited. Note that ideas that require citation may not have been published or written down anywhere.
- While you are free—and indeed encouraged—to discuss assignments with your peers, all of your analysis, and writing should be your own. 
- The consequence for violating these expectations may include receiving no credit for the assignment in question, and at the discretion of the instructor, may include automatic failure of the course.
