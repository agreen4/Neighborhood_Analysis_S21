“I got a couple of my best students and put a series of facts into charts: the size and growth of the Negro American group; its division by age and sex; its distribution, education and occupations; its books and periodicals. We made a most interesting set of drawings, limned on pasteboard cards about a yard square and mounted on a number of moveable standards. The details of finishing these 50 or more charts, in colors, with accuracy, was terribly difficult with little money, limited time and not much encouragement.”

#   Basic template

- ggplot: "Initialize" a map object (data frame, aesthetics, columns...)
- geom: add layers (use the ** + ** operator)
- The **+** sign used to add new layers must be placed at the end of the line


```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()

```
