# Neighborhood Analysis
.font-35[Session 1: Course Introduction]

???
Welcome to our first class... let's start with a simple question...
---
name: What is a neighborhood?
class: middle, inverse

# What is a <br> .salt[.fancy[neighborhood?]]

`r countdown(minutes = 2, seconds=0, color_text = "white", top=0, font_size="4em")`

???
Take two minutes to think about how you might define a neighborhood - don't worry, there's no right or wrong answers here - this is just to help us start developing some foundational definitions.

# There's less consensus about <br> .fat[how to define]<br> neighborhoods than you might think

???
We use neighborhoods to represent lots of different things - administrative geographies, personal and community identities, geographic units for plans...

Let's start by looking at a fairly normative view on what a neighborhood is...

This is an image from the 1950 comprehensive plan for Champaign, IL. This visual is designed to represent the qualities of a neighborhood unit. Looking at this what are some of the core functions of a neighborhood?

We can zoom in on the text description to learn more about some of the intended qualities for a neighborhood.

???
- self contained
- scale
- local institutions
- civil society
- infrastructure
- accessible

The argument for neighborhood planning focuses on livability and economy

???
It's also important to note that neighborhoods scale in relationship to other neighborhoods - an important component of our work together is thinking about how neighborhoods fit with each other and how they compare to each other.

# Course Overview and Objectives

.font-35[
- Together, we will learn techniques for analyzing the demographic, economic, physical, and social conditions that exist at the neighborhood scale
- We will focus on the craft of translating multiple sources of information into stories that can be used to inform decision making
- We will focus on telling stories about the past, present, and future of neighborhoods
- We will learn to work with and layer many types of information, including census data,  administrative data, and data extracted from the internet
