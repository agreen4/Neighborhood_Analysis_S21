We’ll also think through two foundational questions:","tags":null,"title":"Session 1: Course Introduction","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  With those basics in mind, you can start to explore the basic functionality of R.\nStarting Simple - Math and Basic Operators Now that you have a basic lay of the land for the RStudio console, we can start to explore some logic and functionality. Let’s start simple - with some basic math operators. Try doing some basic math by typing in the console window and hitting return / enter to execute:\n2+2 ## [1] 4 Note that you type in code, R executes it, and immediately below what you’ve typed in, it has returned an answer. Here are some of the most common mathematical operators which you’ll take advantage of:\n + Addition - Subtraction * Multiplication / Division ^ Exponent (e.g. 2^3 = 8) () parentheses (to enforce a desired order of operations - r automatically follows the typical order of operation rules)  There are also some built in mathematical constants:\npi ## [1] 3.141593 Which makes it really easy to figure out things, like the area of a circle with a radius of 5 (recall \\(A = \\pi r^2\\)):\npi*5^2 ## [1] 78.53982 While we won’t be doing much (if any) math this way, it’s important to become familiar with how this works, and what the expected response is from R.\n Assigning values to objects One of the useful things about R is that it is an object oriented programming language. This means that we can easily assign values to objects and then use those objects in calculations later on. We can assign values using the \u0026lt;- assignment operator.\nr \u0026lt;- 5 Hmm - what did we do here? We assigned the value 5 to a variable named r. That variable could have just about any name - the name isn’t really important - it’s just a place holder. Notice in our environment window that we have a new row that shows a variable named r with a value of 5. We can easily retrieve this value by typing the name of the variable in our console:\nr ## [1] 5 This means we can use it in place of a value anywhere in our code:\npi*r^2 ## [1] 78.53982 If we assigned a new value to r, the value would change:\nr\u0026lt;-10 pi*r^2 ## [1] 314.1593 Instead of returning a value from an operation to our console, we could also store that in a variable:\ncircle_area\u0026lt;-pi*r^2 And now we could retrieve that:\ncircle_area ## [1] 314.1593 This will become more intuitive the more you use R. Now’s a good time to start to internalize some conventions around variable naming.\n Variables are case sensitive, so variable and Variable are different things. Variables cannot start with numerals, they must start with a letter Variables cannot contain spaces. Convention is to use an underscore or period (e.g. variable_one or variable.one) if you want to denote spaces in a variable name. If you define a variable with the same name as an R constant (such as pi), your variable will supersede R’s value:  pi ## [1] 3.141593 pi\u0026lt;-2000 pi ## [1] 2000 You will start to develop your own naming conventions for variables as you learn R. Keeping variable names short and descriptive becomes important, particularly as you add objects to your workspace.\nAs we learn more about other R features, you’ll also want to avoid naming variables in ways that are similar to R functions. No need to worry about those details just yet, but keep this in mind as we move along.\nFinally, keep in mind that you can remove existing variables from your workspace using the rm() command. rm() will accept in the bracket the name of the object you’d like to remove (be careful is this is permanent):\nrm(pi) Even more finally, if you want to clear your entire workspace, you can do so as follows (remember that this is a permanent clearing):\nrm(list=ls())  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"436c88d459f5739722b21208c83291f8","permalink":"/howto/howto/04-basic_commands/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/howto/howto/04-basic_commands/","section":"howto","summary":"With those basics in mind, you can start to explore the basic functionality of R.\nStarting Simple - Math and Basic Operators Now that you have a basic lay of the land for the RStudio console, we can start to explore some logic and functionality.","tags":null,"title":"Your First Commands","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  R is an open source programming language that is a common tool used for data analysis across a range of disciplines. This means that in addition to being free and available for a range of operating systems and environments, R is also directly supported by a diverse user community who continually develop approaches for specialized applications or data. Need to download U.S. Census Data? There’s an R package for that. Need to perform common data cleaning tasks? There’s an R package for that too. We’ll be exploring a range of these specialized applications over the course of the semester.\nOf course there are alternate languages which we could employ in service of neighborhood analysis. Python, for example, is an even more ubiquitous programming language with its own set of tools for data science. R was originally built as a statistical computing language, and that brings some important benefits for the types of data science we’ll be learning this semester. R is also fairly prevalent among the user community working in public policy analysis and urban data science - this is the user community which you will be joining. Finally, R has a high learning curve, but also a very active user community, meaning that abundant documentation of problems and their solutions is available.\nAs we get started, let’s be clear - you are going to experience some frustration and challenges as you learn the R programming language. This class assumes no prior background in R or any other programming language for that matter, and we’ll work to quickly build your “vocabulary” and the ability to get results. We will spend some time picking up basics, and will then use our exploration of specific analysis approaches to reinforce our use of the grammar and structure of the language and to build more complex scripts over time.\nIt’s fair to equate learning R with learning to drive a manual car. Increasingly, people learn how to drive in automatic cars - essentially allowing the car to handle the function of switching gears - you put the car into drive, press the accelerator pedal and the car moves forward. Your past exposure to computer-based analytic tools has probably followed a similar strategy - you likely learned using software that had graphical user interfaces that allow them to call up and run programs and then spit out results. Most of us learn to point and click in order to accomplish a particular set of analytic tasks, meaning that if we want to generate the same results in the future, we would have to repeat all of those same steps over again.\nSo why learn on a manual? For many car enthusiasts, manuals are both more efficient and more engaging to drive - they offer additional control, and come with a heightened awareness of what the car is doing. Of course, they also come with a steep learning curve.\nSome of the same attributes apply to our use of R as a tool for analysis. First, a manual approach forces you to explicitly understand more of the requirements and assumptions that go into the analysis that you’re doing. Second, you have to know your data (and its strengths and limitations) well in order to get it set up for analysis and to produce useful output. Third, this approach emphasizes reproducible analysis, meaning that you will develop workflows that can be repeated over and over again producing the same results - important for sharing your work with others and for accountability, especially within contexts related to public deliberation of the strengths and weaknesses of policy arguments.\nKeeping these three benefits in mind, we’ll be using the R software coupled with the RStudio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to counter some of the downsides of a purely manual approach. RStudio will help us implement R code more effectively and efficiently. Hopefully at this point, this prospect leaves you excited rather than daunted!\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"736ff88980c16b6e589aa3aa15e7610f","permalink":"/howto/howto/00-get_started/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/howto/howto/00-get_started/","section":"howto","summary":"R is an open source programming language that is a common tool used for data analysis across a range of disciplines.

During the first two weeks of the class, you will develop your grading contact, which outlines the grade you are contracting for in the class as well as the agreed upon expectations for attaining that grade.\nThe grade you receive at the end of the class will be based on whether you did the work which you contracted for. Separately from this assessment, you will receive feedback on the qualities of your work.\n Please use the following contract template to construct your proposed learning contract for the semester.   A few guidelines for constructing your contract:\n For most of you, your learning contract will include the following baseline standard items in order to contract for a grade of “B”:  Class Interaction  Attend Class Regularly: Show up for course sessions before or on time, be absent from no more than three course sessions over the course of the semester. If you are unable to be present due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, please let me know before the course session in which you are absent, and I will consider excusing the absent. Participate Actively: In addition to showing up to class sessions on time, you are expected to make thoughtful and informed contributions to our class community. This includes coming to class prepared and having completed readings, reflections and assignments. This also includes thoughtful engagement with course material, asking and responding to questions, and helping other students familiarize course concepts. Be Visible: Due to necessary COVID-19 safety precautions, most of our synchronous course sessions will be offered via Zoom. Active participation in the discussion portions of our course ask that you engage with your camera on. If there are reasons you cannot meet this expectation, you may propose omitting or modifying this component of your contract. Submit Work On Time: There will be three grade reconciliation periods in the semester. Each assignment will be due within a reconciliation period. Each assignment will also list a recommended due date. You are responsible for submitting your work by the end of the grade reconciliation period. Work due within a reconciliation period that is submitted within 48 hours of the conclusion of that period will be counted as late. Work due within a reconciliation period submitted more than 48 hours will be considered ignored.  Assignments  Class Reflections: On a weekly basis, you will reflect briefly on a few questions that guide our work in that week. R Learner’s Permit: You will complete the R Learner’s Permit notebook which tests your knowledge of basic R programming concepts. Lab Notebooks (3): Throughout the course you will work with lab notebooks that are designed to help you learn new analytical concepts, approaches, and datasets. You will select three of these notebooks to polish and submit for review. Term Project Proposal: You will develop a proposal for your term project, which asks you to perform an in-depth analysis around a theme of your choice. Your proposal will provide a broad overview rationale for your project, and will lay out details that will go into the project background and completed project. Term Project Background: Your project background documentation will build upon your term project proposal. You will provide a detailed exploration of data and analysis strategies for your term project, and will also start to sketch out key outputs and findings. Completed Project: You will produce a final project which will include a complete project rationale, background, and analysis. Project Presentation: Graduate students are required to prepare a 10-minute presentation on their project which they will give at the end of the semester. Undergraduates may elect to include a presentation as an extended component of their contract.  Contract Extensions and Deletions  You may propose contract extensions in order to contract for a higher grade. You may propose contract deletions in order to contract for a lower grade.    After you submit your proposed learning contract, we will schedule a 20-minute one-on-one meeting to discuss your goals and contract elements. After that meeting (and after any agreed upon revisions are made), we will sign your contract and you will be held to contracted standards.

Visit https://cloud.r-project.org which will automatically direct you to the best download server.\nOnce here, you can then download and install R using the version that matches your operating system:\nGo ahead and download R and install following the installer defaults. After R is downloaded and installed, run R to confirm. You should see a single window that looks something like this:\nThat’s it for R. This should be the first and last time you’ll need to open the R console directly. We typically will not access R directly, but instead will use RStudio as our primary interface. Go ahead and close the R console and proceed by downloading and installing RStudio, which is the IDE we will use to interface and write code with R.\n Downlad RStudio Next up, let’s download RStudio. Go to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download. Click on “Download” under RStudio Desktop. The website will suggest the most appropriate current version of the software based upon the computer you are loading RStudio on. You may also choose from an alternate installer if you believe it is more appropriate for your operating system.\nDownload and install RStudio, again using the default installation settings.\nOnce you have RStudio installed, open RStudio. You should see something that looks like this (the information in your console window will likely describe a newer version of R than what is displayed here).\nYou’ll note that what appears in the portion of the console to the left looks very similar to the R console window which you opened before you started your install of RStudio. This console functions in exactly the same way, however, you’ll also note that there are other areas which you have access to as well.\n## The RStudio Interface\n The R Console is the place where code you write is executed. Typically we’ll write code in a script or R Notebook (more on those later) and active pieces of code will them be executed in the R console. You can also type code directly into the console and execute it by hitting the return or enter key. The Environment Window provides information on variables, data tables, and other objects you create and define as you work. The Auxiliary Window provides a range of information, and includes a file browser, plot visualization window, and access to help documentation.

This is the data you will use to earn your learner’s permit.\nThese are “real world” data derived from two sources:\nNew York City housing maintainance code violation data for the years 2009 to 2019 Data on property characteristics from the Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) database  I have merged selected columns from these datasets for you (you will find data documentation and metadata for both datasets in the documentation subfolder), and after taking a close look at the dataset and the documentation, you should be able to identify which portions of the data you will work with come from each dataset. It’s my assumption that you have likely not worked with these data before - that’s part of the point!\nThe PLUTO data contains information on each tax lot within the city of New York. By merging these data which contain characteristics of buildings and land with the building code violation data, the data you have to work with describes the characteristics of the building and property where the violation occurred as well as the nature of the violation.

Wasser   At the same time, there are some really good reasons to gain familiarity with R and RStudio, particularly within the context of urban planning analysis.\n R and RStudio are open source tools, and are therefore available to be downloaded and used without cost (this does not negate questions regarding accessibility of the language, given its steep learning curve) R and RStudio are supported by a wide range of users who develop packages for specific use cases, including those that are useful for urban planning analysis (we will spend more time learning about packages later in this lab) R and RStudio provide a framework for reproducible data manipulation and analysis - rather than sharing output with others, we can share raw data and code and they can reproduce our output Principles of reproducible analysis make it easy to modify previous code for new data or use cases  Thinking about the type of analysis we will do in this class, there are some additional rationales for learning and working in R and RStudio:\n R has a powerful set of functions for aggregating and manipulating many data records into a smaller number of summary records - we use these types of functions frequently to summarize neighborhood characteristics R can natively read from and write to many types of data sources - this allows us to perform most or all of our analysis within a single applcation rather than passing data between applications for different types of manipulation or analysis R can help us to automate elements of data visualization, which can be useful when we need to reproduce forms of analysis for different places or other data categories Looking beyond the reasons to use R and RStudio as a platform for analysis, these tools represent one of several programming languages frequently used for data science (the other main language being Python) - learning these langugages prepares you for future interface with other data science tools and strategies  With the basic rationale laid out, let’s start exploring the logic behind the R language.\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b3adacd42c9a51e24adadd3c568f0e7d","permalink":"/schedule/session/03-starting_with_data/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/schedule/session/03-starting_with_data/","section":"schedule","summary":"Session Description In this session, we’ll take our first foray into the R and RStudio ecosystem.

As you will hear many times in class, almost every problem you encounter in R, someone else has also encountered. A few tips:\nStart with R’s internal help. in your console, you can search for documentation for a given command by prefacing it with a question mark (e.g. ?mean). You can also type help() to access general help in R.\n Next, turn to the internet. You might start with R Documentation or Stack Overflow.\n Get help from our class community. A big portion of our time together in class will be devoted to learning from each other - part of that includes learning to troubleshoot problems. We’ll devote some synchronous time in class to working through challenges, and will supplement that with asynchronous means of communication via our course Slack channel. Ask questions early and often - there’s no need to unduly suffer through setbacks (although as you solve these you will learn deeply how to address similar problems in the future).\n  Whenever I get discouraged and want to quit something, I remember the words of my then 3 year-old after she puked carrots all over the living room floor: \u0026quot;I\u0026#39;m gonna need more carrots.\u0026quot;\n\u0026mdash; Jessica Valenti (@JessicaValenti) January 18, 2021  While not set up as a support resource, there are other websites that may help you to extend your capacity in R.\n Some of the initial tutorials we’ll use to learn R come from Data Carpentry, especially their series on R for Social Scientists and Introduction to R for Geospatial Data. The swirl package is designed to teach you the basics of R in R. Check out other useful tutorials available at r4ds, STHDA.com, and R Bloggers. A “classic” framing document for new learners of R is The R Inferno. Another important framing document is Keiran Healy’s The Plain Person’s Guide to Plain Text Social Science.

Also check out Julia Silge’s blog and video tutorials that perform more advanced analysis on Tidy Tuesday data.

That strategy also overlooks most of the features of what GitHub is at its core - a version control system.\nWe might want to version our work for several reasons:\n To keep track of changes we’ve made, so that we can track when code works and when we’ve broken it To be able to share code with collaborators and work on the same files at the same time and then reconcile and combine work all together To be able to share code and data publicly with others  All three of these rationales are important motivations within the context of our class. There are two strategies which you may want to try to integrate GitHub into your R workflow.\nUsing the GitHub Desktop Client GitHub Desktop is an application that allows you to upload, download, and reconcile github repositories stored on your computer with your GitHub account. From GitHub desktop, you can create new repositories, download previously created repositories, and upload new versions of repository contents to the cloud.\n Using RStudio’s integrated Github Functionality RStudio has GitHub functionality built right in, which is very handy for integrating version control into your R workflow. Getting RStudio set up to work with GitHub can be a bit tedious, but once it is set up, it is straightforward to use. An outstanding resource to help you get GitHub integrated with R is Happy Git and GitHub for the useR. As the authors mention in a section titled appropriately Is It Going to Hurt?, integrating Git changes your workflow. However, since many of you are just starting to learn R, making this part of your typical workflow early on will be challenging, but less of a change from other ways of doing things.\nAssuming you’ve already got R and RStudio installed on your system and have already set up a GitHub account, you can start here:\nCheck to see if Git is installed on your computer, and if it isnt, Install Git. Associate git on your computer with your GitHub account. Install a Git client like GitHub Desktop. Connect to GitHub Connect RStudio to GitHub Get Started using GitHub integrated with R (we’ll talk more about this in class).

Your proposal should address the following:\nOutline the question or problem which your analysis will examine. You should provide a clear and succinct description of the question or problem, and also discuss its relevance - who will the answer to this question be relevant to? How might your analysis guide their actions? Describe the context within which the question or problem exists in such a way that it is clear why answering this question is of value. What’s the geographic location and scale you are examining? Why is this question of importance here? Who is impacted by the phenomena you seek to explore? What do we already know, and what information is missing? How will you engage both the known and the unknown through exploration of your question? Propose a strategy for how you will approach the problem that is clear, connected to the question and context, and that is appropriate for the information you plan to use.

This portfolio would include polished output suitable to share with a prospective employer or internship site.\n Extend a Lab Notebook: Over the course of the semester, you’ll be working through several lab notebooks that walk you through techniques and approaches to different modes of neighborhood analysis. You could propose extending the analysis you are asked to do in these notebooks beyond what is asked of you in the lab. This might include a more expanded analysis of the data, or the application of the lab concepts to a different context or data of your choosing. Extending a lab notebook should involve producing some type of formalized output that is polished and ready for review.\n Write an Op Ed: Your final project asks you to perform a neighborhood-level analysis of your own design that is policy-relevant to a particular place. Based upon what your analysis reveals, you may have policy-relevant conclusions that it would be useful to share with a public audience. You can write an OpEd targeting a local newspaper that articulates a persuasive public argument and that draws substantively from your analysis. Good resources for this include The OpEd Project, the New York Times, Goh and Bourne, and Scientific American.\n Develop a proposed extension to your final project: It is likely that your final project will produce some insightful information drawing upon your analysis of existing data. It is also likely that through the process of conducting your analysis that you will reach the limits of what the data can tell you, and that you will have additional questions which you would like to answer. You can develop a proposed set of next steps based upon what you would do to continue to develop the analysis which you have conducted. This might include gaining insight from other sources of secondary data, applying other types of analytical techniques, or developing a plan for primary data collection to supplement your existing analysis.\n  These are a few suggested ways in which you can contract to extend your grade. You may have other ideas which you would like to propose. Please spend some time early in the class thinking about what your goals are this semester, and what work (in addition to our base expectations) might be part of this. Please be prepared to share these ideas when we meet one-on-one early in the semester to review your contract proposal. Of course we can also talk through some of these ideas in our class sessions during the first few weeks of class. As part of your contract proposal you will need to write a description of each extended contract component. Please be prepared to share this when we meet.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"664e73e4de7668722c77028cf1a0dc31","permalink":"/assignments/assignments/06_contract_extension/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/assignments/06_contract_extension/","section":"assignments","summary":"Here are some ideas for contract extensions you may wish to propose (you can of course develop and propose other ideas as well):\n Develop a Neighborhood Analysis Portfolio: You could contract to create a portfolio of your analysis work over the course of the semester.","tags":null,"title":"Contract Extension Ideas","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Session Description  Before Class Klosterman 2\n Slides  Other Resources  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c4db7c7cda6ed60cb7b2bb23127da158","permalink":"/schedule/session/08-population_pt1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/schedule/session/08-population_pt1/","section":"schedule","summary":"  Session Description  Before Class Klosterman 2\n Slides  Other Resources  ","tags":null,"title":"Session 8: Population and Population Change (Session 1)","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"  Session Description  Before Class Natalie P.

While our focus will be on analyzing current conditions, we will also learn how to tell stories about neighborhood change, and will learn how to project and forecast future trends. We will learn how to describe community characteristics with small area census data, work with local administrative data, and will think about how our analysis of quantitative data fit with other forms of data and engagement fill in gaps in knowledge.\nBy the end of this course, we will:\nBecome familiar with common sources of information used to describe neighborhoods and neighborhood characteristics; Learn how to use R, RStudio, and Github to create reproducible analysis of neighborhood-level information; Learn how to use the information to tell compelling stories for deliberation and decision-making;   Course Format and Expectations We will learn together using a combination of direct instruction, lab sessions, and tutorials. We will use reading and reflection to help us contextualize our understanding of neighborhoods, however, our focus will be on learning by doing.\nOur class will typically meet synchronously online twice per week. As the weather improves (and assuming public health concerns abate), some course sessions may include the option to meet in person following all University of Illinois classroom safety precautions).\nPlease plan on working on a laptop or desktop computer that will run R and RStudio (available for PC/Mac/Linux) and for which you have administrative privileges.\nGiven our focus on learning by doing, I am expecting a polished end product by the end of the semester. As you will note in the in the syllabus section on your Grading Contract, we will use a contract-based evaluation system this semester. Regardless of the grade you contract for, I expect that your final work in this class will be high quality, meaning that it is ready for public dissemination.\nWhat to Expect from Me  Availability: I am generally accessible 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday, however I have research and administrative commitments in addition to teaching and advising during the work week. I have reserved dedicated time on Tuesdays and Thursdays to focus on our class and student advising. Communicating: The easiest ways to communicate with me outside of class are via email or our course Slack channel. I try to respond to emails sent during the week within 24 hours. Emails sent over the weekend will receive a response within 48 hours. If you don’t hear from me after that amount of time elapses, it is okay to nudge me to respond. Office Hours: Please feel welcome to make an appointment to speak (virtually) one-on-one. The easiest way to schedule a meeting with me is via the dedicated Calendly page for our class. Troubleshooting: You should feel welcome to use email, slack, and office hours to get help with troubleshooting problems as they arise in your work. The Resources page provides thoughts and resources for troubleshooting errors as they occur. I suggest using Slack as an initial support for problems you are having - it is highly likely that others in the class have encountered similar problems, and also allows us to create a repository of our problems and responses.   What I Expect from You  Be Present: I expect that you’ll engage fully in our course sessions and in our class community. Actively Support Each Other: I expect that each of you will take on leadership roles within our class, that includes actively supporting our learning community over the course of the semester. While this expectation becomes harder to meet due to remote learning, those circumstances make it all the more important to engage each other and to be present for each other. Read with Care: This course focuses on learning by doing, however, there are important details contained within the documentation on our course website and within reading selections. As you will soon learn, details matter in this class. Be intentional about reading carefully and completely important course documents (including this syllabus). Act with Integrity: I expect that you will act with integrity in all that you do in this class. The class contract grading system places a lot of trust in you to not just meet the nominal standards contained within the contract, but to push yourself to produce your best work. Seek Balance: I expect that you’ll actively work to find balance between the many demands in your life. This means finding time for adequate rest and sleep, exercise, and other actions that support your mental and physical health. This also means budgeting adequate time to engage fully in our course.   Prerequisites UP 494-AG: Neighborhood Analysis has no prerequisites aside from upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level standing.\n Students will benefit from some prior knowledge of urban planning concepts, and analytic techniques, although these can be learned along the way. Students will also benefit from some prior knowledge working in R and RStudio, however, this is also not a course prerequisite. The first few weeks of our class incorporate an accelerated schedule for learning R and RStudio to support your deeper learning of neighborhood analysis. Please plan your time accordingly.  Please talk with me if you have any questions regarding whether this course is right for you.\n  Assignments You will find detailed information on assignments in the Assignments section.\n    Assignment Due Date Description    Grading Contract February 5, 2021 You will propose an individual grading contract by which you will be assessed this semester.  R Learner’s Permit February 19, 2021 You will demonstrate a basic understanding of the R programming language by completing the description of a dataset.  Class Reflections Ongoing On a weekly basis, you will reflect upon questions related to our class and your work.  Polished Lab Notebooks March 19, 2021 April 21, 2021 We will introduce new course material and analysis strategies via a series of lab notebooks. You will extend the work you have done in two of these notebooks and submit them for assessment.

Final Project May 7, 2021 You will complete an independent policy analysis on a topic of your choice and will submit it along with a repository containing your code and supporting materials.    Contract Extensions You may want to propose extensions to your contract in order to contract for a higher grade. You will find more information and inspiration for proposed contract extensions in the Assignments section.\n  Evaluation and Grading Contract Alongside our learning of techniques and perspectives on working with small area data, a primary goal of this class is to learn to think critically about the ways in which those data and our analysis embody power and exist within power relationships. One implicit goal of our learning this semester is to embody through our work alternative ways to share power and create meaning. We will share power and authority for the evaluation of learning by establishing individualized grading contracts which will allow you to set many of the terms upon which your work is evaluated this semester. You will be held accountable to the standards you propose and we agree upon.\nWe are using this approach for several reasons:\nImplementing a contract-based assessment approach mirrors some of the broader course goals regarding our understanding and practice around the power of data, particularly with regards to public deliberation, decision-making, and governance. Dealing differently with power around evaluation in our classroom mirrors how we might deal with power and power relationships around other processes we participate in, including professional practice. A unitary assessment of performance in a 400-level class is not likely to serve students well. This class is open to advanced undergraduate students, masters students, and doctoral students - some who are pursuing degrees in planning and others who are not. Given the heterogeneity of our learning community and your individual motivations for taking this class, contracts will allow us to assess your work against your own expectations and your evaluation of learning goals and capacity this semester. There is increasing evidence in higher education settings that traditional unitary grading measures tend to hamper individual learning, and have the potential to be biased towards certain types of students. Put simply, obsessing about grades in advanced coursework is counter-productive to deep learning. This course adheres to the pedagogy that when given more control and ownership over the terms of evaluation, a student is more likely to embrace the challenges presented to them within the classroom, and are more likely to take ownership of their work (see, for instance Elbow and Inoue). We are attempting to learn together through a set of extremely challenging times. The impact of COVID-19 on your lives and your learning should not be discounted. The impact is also very individualized to each of your situations. A unitary grading standard would typically be strained to account for your circumstances.  Baseline Standards Each of you is expected to meet the following baseline standards. By doing so, you will earn a grade of “B”.\n Attend class regularly: Show up for course sessions before or on time, be absent from no more than three course sessions over the course of the semester. If you are unable to be present due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, please let me know before the course session in which you are absent, and I will consider excusing the absent.\n Participate actively: In addition to showing up to class sessions on time, you are expected to make thoughtful and informed contributions to our class community. This includes coming to class prepared and having completed readings, reflections and assignments. This also includes thoughtful engagement with course material, asking and responding to questions, and helping other students learn course concepts. Be visible: Due to necessary COVID-19 safety precautions, our synchronous course sessions will be offered via Zoom. Active participation during the discussion portion of our class involves engaging with your camera on. Please communicate with me if you anticipate barriers to meeting this expectation, and we can discuss appropriate accommodations via alterations to your grading contract. Submit work on time: Your assignments have due dates. You are responsible for submitting your work by this date. Work submitted within 48 hours of the due date will be counted as late. Work submitted more than 48 hours after the due date will be considered ignored.   Expectation Summary The baseline contract standard in the class is a “B”. You may customize your grading contract to contract for a grade between A and C (C, C+, B-, B, B+, A-, A). The below table will help you to propose accountability expectations:\n   Grade Absences Late Missed Ignored    A 3 1 0 0  B 3 1 0 0  C 4 2 1 1  D 5 3 2 1  F 6 4 3 1     Absences indicate the number of times you can be absent from class. Additional excused absences may be allowed due to documented extenuating circumstances. Late Assignments are assignments submitted within 48 hours of the due date. Missed Assignments are assignments submitted more than 48 hours after the due date. Note that missing assignments is considered a more serious breach of your contract when compared to late assignments. Ignored Assignments are assignments that are not submitted by the last day of class (excluding your final assignment). Ignored assignments are a more serious breach of contract than missed assignments as they reflect contracted work which you have not completed.  Please note that assessment of these contracted standards are based upon what you do. The default contracted “B” grade does not include any direct assessment of the quality of your work. As you design your personalized learning contract, you can use the above table to help you propose expectations in line with the final grade you wish to contract to receive.\n Preparing your Contract Our grading system this semester focuses on capturing the consistent application of your labor towards our course goals. If you consistently submit your work as contracted, you’ll receive a “B” at the end of the semester. Consequently, to contract for a higher (or lower) grade, you may commit yourself to applying more (or less) labor in support of course goals when you design your contract.\n Please use the following contract template to construct your proposed learning contract for the semester.     Honor Code The Illinois Student Code states: “It is the responsibility of the student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions.” Note that you are subject to the Honor Code, as well as procedures for addressing violations to the Code, regardless of whether you have read it and understand it. According to the Code, “ignorance is no excuse.”\nTo meet this standard in this course, note the following: in written work, all ideas (as well as data or other information) that are not your own must be cited. Note that ideas that require citation may not have been published or written down anywhere. While you are free—and indeed encouraged—to discuss assignments with your peers, all of your analysis, and writing should be your own. The consequence for violating these expectations may include receiving no credit for the assignment in question, and may include automatic failure of the course.\n Put simply, don’t cheat and give credit where credit is due.    Learning Environment and Support Learning Environment: The Department of Urban and Regional Planning is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is rooted in the goals and responsibilities of professional planners. By enrolling in a class offered by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, students agree to be responsible for maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect in all activities, including lectures, discussions, labs, projects, and extracurricular opportunities. See Student Code Article 1-Student Rights and Responsibilities, Part 1. Student Rights: §1-102.\nCounseling Center and Student Support: Throughout the semester, you may need assistance coping with emotional, interpersonal, or academic concerns. The Counseling Center provides both short-term and longer-term counseling to students who may need assistance. Please do not hesitate to reach out or request assistance.\n Your Wellness Learning R and your Wellness Whether you have prior experience working in R or not, you will face challenges related to working with the software this semester. That’s a given, and is an expected part of learning in this class. Part of the goal is to teach you how to understand the intentionality behind the software so that you can anticipate where errors are likely to occur.\n The only way to do this, is to encounter errors - and there will be many!   You are learning a new language, it’s grammar, and its application. While this will be frustrating at times, there is a major payoff in the capacity you will gain in analytic skills and problem-solving. This payoff will come slowly over time - do not expect it to come easily.\n  Image by Allison Horst   You are not alone in this struggle. In addition to your classmates and others who are going through the same thing, there is a large R user community, and lots of existing documentation and troubleshooting on sites like Stack Overflow and RStudio Community. Any problem you will encounter has likely been encountered and addressed before. When I run into an error, after an initial check for simple issues like closing parentheses and spelling errors, I copy and paste error codes directly into a web search to see how others have dealt with similar problems. I encourage you to do the same.\nYou got this, and there will be a payoff, so long as you use the tools consistently - I promise!\n Covid and your Wellness These are not normal times, and it would be irresponsible to expect that teaching and learning would occur “normally” given the circumstances. We are teaching and learning under emergency circumstances amidst a global pandemic. I understand that you have lives outside of this class and more generally outside of your studies, and I understand that especially given the current circumstances that things will come up that take your attention away from our coursework.\nWhile I will expect a lot of you this semester, I am also willing to be flexible. I have designed course deliverable dates with this flexibility in mind, and will devote some of our class time to checking in about class progress. In return, I need you to communicate with me, either during those course sessions or individually. You can schedule an appointment with me at your convenience via my Calendly page. I promise to listen, to be a resource, and to help in any way that I can - if I can’t help you, I will find someone who can.\n  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course Overview and Objectives Course Format and Expectations What to Expect from Me What I Expect from You Prerequisites  Assignments Contract Extensions  Evaluation and Grading Contract Baseline Standards Expectation Summary Preparing your Contract  Honor Code Learning Environment and Support Your Wellness Learning R and your Wellness Covid and your Wellness    Course Overview and Objectives This course teaches techniques for analyzing the demographic, economic, physical, and social conditions that exist at the neighborhood and local government scale.","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
