## Session Description
In this session, we'll spend some more time learning how to use more advanced tools for data manipulation. We will talk about principles of *tidy* data, and explore the use of the `dplyr` package for more efficient data manipulation and summarization.

## Before Class

Data Carpentry ([Manipulating Data Frames](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html))

Please [download the Session 4 workbook](/schedule/session/04-Manipulating_Data_files/Session 4 Lab.zip).

Optional: Check out Allison Horsts' [interactive dplyr tutorial](https://allisonhorst.shinyapps.io/dplyr-learnr/)

In this lab, you are introduced to the `dplyr` package, which is designed to help us manipulate rectangular data frames. `dplyr` is an extremely useful replacement for some of the base R commands for querying our data.

- The use of pipes (`%>%`) greatly helps with the legibility of our commands and allows us to see each of the manipulation steps we are taking our data through before producing a result.
- Commands like `filter()` and `select()` allow us to query out rows and columns of our dataset respectively.
- The `summarise()` command allows us to produce summary tables of our dataset which are very useful for exploring patterns and producing information on small multiples of data.
- The `group_by()` command allows us to specify grouping variables for our summaries.
