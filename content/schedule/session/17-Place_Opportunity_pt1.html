<h2>Session Description</h2>
<p>In this session, we’ll begin to examine opportunity analysis and mapping, which is a strategy used to compare multiple measures of sociodemographic wellbeing to create a single measure of how supportive a place is for economic and social mobility. Opportunity mapping in various forms has been used to craft legal remedies to discrimination and segregation, to design policy interventions, and as a source of information for planning and the allocation of resources.</p>
<p>Your readings for today provide a) a contemporary overview of opportunity mapping, and b) a conceptual overview of the application of opportunity mapping by one of it’s originators, john powell.</p>
<p>In addition to our discussion of opportunity mapping, we’ll also take a few moments to check in on your final assignment progress, your detailed project description, and more generally about how things are going with the class.</p>
