## Session Description

In this session, we'll begin to examine opportunity analysis and mapping, which is a strategy used to compare multiple measures of sociodemographic wellbeing to create a single measure of how supportive a place is for economic and social mobility. Opportunity mapping in various forms has been used to craft legal remedies to discrimination and segregation, to design policy interventions, and as a source of information for planning and the allocation of resources.

Your readings for today provide a) a contemporary overview of opportunity mapping, and b) a conceptual overview of the application of opportunity mapping by one of it's originators, john powell.

In addition to our discussion of opportunity mapping, we'll also take a few moments to check in on your final assignment progress, your detailed project description, and more generally about how things are going with the class.

## This Week's Reflection Questions

- What does place opportunity mean to you? What makes a place more (or less) opportune?
- Are there some universal dimensions of place opportunity? Some that are more specific to certain population groups?
- What types of practices support opportunity mapping? How can we use the outputs from opportunity mapping excercises for deliberation and policy decision-making?
