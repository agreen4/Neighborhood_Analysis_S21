## Session Description

This session marks our first explorations of data visualization in R using the [GGPlot2 package](https://ggplot2-book.org). We will spend time working through structuring our data for visualization, and work to develop several options for visualizing common data types. We will also talk about pre-visualization and thinking about how data fits into our narrative structure.

## This Week's Reflection Prompt

- How is working with data via a command line interface different from using a graphical user interface?
- How do we balance reproducibility of our analysis with accessibility of the analytical tools?
- What's challenging for you right now regarding learning and using R? What are the "a-ha" moments that you're celebrating?
