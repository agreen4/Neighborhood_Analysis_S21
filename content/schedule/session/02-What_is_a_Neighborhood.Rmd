## Session Description

In this session, we'll explore the many ways in which the concept of neighborhoods are used in various areas of urban planning and governance. We will continue to build upon previous questions regarding the significance of neighborhoods as a unit of analysis, planning, and policymaking, and will explore frameworks for neighborhood analysis.
