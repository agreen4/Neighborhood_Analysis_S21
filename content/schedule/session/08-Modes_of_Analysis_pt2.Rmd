## Session Description

In this session, you will present your institutional analysis plans which you discussed in class on Tuesday. We'll start with 10 minutes for your groups to convene and finalize your presentation. Each group will then have 5 minutes to present, and 10 minutes for discussion.

We'll go in this order:

1. Austin Neighbors United
2. Chicago Council of Small Business Owners
3. City of Chicago
4. Metropolitan Planning Council

We will also talk briefly about our lab for next week, which focuses on basic measures of population.
