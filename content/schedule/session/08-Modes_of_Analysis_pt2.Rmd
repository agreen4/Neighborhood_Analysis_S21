## Session Description

In this session, you will present your institutional analysis plans which you discussed in class on Tuesday. We'll start with 10 minutes for your groups to convene and finalize your presentation. Each group will then have 5 minutes to present, and 10 minutes for discussion.

We will also talk briefly about our lab for next week, which focuses on basic measures of population.
