## Session Description

Today is an independent work day - there are no course sessions scheduled for today. You should use this time to continue working, and to take stock of your progress.

## Before Class

Professor Greenlee has extended availability for office hours appointments. If you have not already scheduled an appointment and wish to, please [sign up](https://calendly.com/agreen4/neighborhood-analysis?back=1&month=2021-01) for an advising appointment.
