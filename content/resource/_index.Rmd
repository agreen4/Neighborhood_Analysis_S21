# Learning Resources

This page contains a wealth of resources that will help you over the course of the class. As you encounter more resources that you find useful, please share them so they can be added to this page.

## Required Text

There is one required text for this class: Healey, Keiran, 2019. [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction](https://press.princeton.edu/books/ebook/9780691185064/data-visualization).
Please purchase online or access a [pre-print copy here](https://socviz.co/index.html).

All other readings will be provided online. These files are linked in our course schedule, but you will need to authenticate with your UIUC credentials in order to access them.

## Learning R

One of our rationales for using R this semester is the range of support resources available that have been developed by the user community. As you will hear many times in class, almost every problem you encounter in R, someone else has also encountered. A few tips:

1. **Start with R's internal help.** in your console, you can search for documentation for a given command by prefacing it with a question mark (e.g. `?mean`). You can also type `help()` to access general help in R.

2. Next, **turn to the internet.** You might start with [R Documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

3. **Get help from our class community.** A big portion of our time together in class will be devoted to learning from each other - part of that includes learning to troubleshoot problems. We'll devote some synchronous time in class to working through challenges, and will supplement that with asynchronous means of communication via our course Slack channel. Ask questions *early* and *often* - there's no need to unduly suffer through setbacks (although as you solve these you will learn deeply how to address similar problems in the future).

While not set up as a support resource, there are other websites that may help you to extend your capacity in R. 

- Some of the initial tutorials we'll use to learn R come from [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org), especially their series on [R for Social Scientists](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) and [Introduction to R for Geospatial Data](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/). 
- The [swirl](https://swirlstats.com) package is designed to teach you the basics of R in R.
- Check out other useful tutorials available at [r4ds](https://r4ds.had.co.nz), [STHDA.com](http://www.sthda.com/english/), and [R Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com). 
- A "classic" framing document for new learners of R is [The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf). 
- Another important framing document is Keiran Healy's [The Plain Person's Guide to Plain Text Social Science](https://plain-text.co).
- [Tidy Tuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com): podcast that walks through data analysis using a new dataset weekly in R. Also check out [Julia Silge's](https://juliasilge.com) blog and video tutorials that perform more advanced analysis on Tidy Tuesday data.

# Setting up a Github Repository for your Work
The majority of the work you produce this semester will be submitted via a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository which you will create. 

![codercat](https://octodex.github.com/images/codercat.jpg)

GitHub offers some services for free, however, as a student at an educational institution, you can register via [GitHub for Education](https://education.github.com) to recieve enhanced benefits and services. 

1. If you do not already have a GitHub account, go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and then click on Sign Up to create a new account. You will make a username, enter your email address, and password, and then hit create account. I recommend using your UIUC email address for this step if you're creating a new account.
2. GitHub offers some services for free which you can access with your basic account, however, as a student at an educational institution, you can register with [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com) to receive enhanced benefits and services. You will be asked to verify your association with an academic institution, which you can do by entering your [netid]@illinois.edu email address and taking a picture of your [I-Card](https://www.icardnet.uillinois.edu/public/).
3. While you're logged into your GitHub account, visit the [Neighborhood Analysis Assignment Repository Template](https://github.com/agreen4/Neighborhood_Analysis_S21_Assignments). You will use this repository as a template for your own assignments repository. Within the repository, you'll see a readme file that you can modify to track your work as you upload it. You'll also see folders into which you can upload your assignments. To use the template to create your own assignment repository, click on the green button that says `Use This Template`. On the next screen choose a name for this repository (you can name it whatever you like). You can choose to make the repository **public** or **private**. Public repositories can be seen by anyone. Private repositories can only be seen by those you give permission to (if you make your repository private, you will have to grant me permission to be able to view it for the purposes or grading).
4. From the main folder in your new repository, make note of your username, the repository name, and the URL (for example...)
  - Github Username: agreen4
  - Repository Name: Neighborhood_Analysis_S21
  - Repository URL: https://github.com/agreen4/Neighborhood_Analysis_S21
5. Use the above information to [register your GitHub repository](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/421969060) for our class.
