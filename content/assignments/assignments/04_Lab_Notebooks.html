<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> 1 by March 19, 2021, 2 additional by April 21, 2021 | <strong>Submit Via:</strong> Upload to Github</p>
<p>Over the course of the semester, you will work on a series of lab notebooks which ask you to apply what you’ve learned in class to new data and analysis questions. These lab notebooks will guide you through learning new approaches to manipulating data. At the end of each notebook, there’s information on how you might extend your analysis beyond the lab.</p>
<p>This course requirement asks you to choose three of these labs to produce a more polished analysis and data brief. You may select any of the labs to polish and to work with. You are expected to submit <em>at least</em> one of these polished notebooks in March and two remaining ones in April.</p>
<p>Taking cues from the lab notebook and the prompts you will find at the end of the notebook, prepare a separate analytical notebook using RMarkdown that contains analysis and accompanying write-up. Rather than focusing on specific methodological steps as you will in the lab notebook, you should focus on interpreting the data itself, and posing and answering questions arising from the data. Using your notebook, you will weave together narrative description of the data with your analytic outputs, and should target creating a data brief of between 1,000-2,000 words plus analytic output.</p>
