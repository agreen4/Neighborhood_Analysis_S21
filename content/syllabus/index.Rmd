# Course Overview and Objectives

This course teaches techniques for analyzing the demographic, economic, physical, and social conditions that exist at the neighborhood and local government scale. While our focus will be on analyzing current conditions, we will also learn how to tell stories about neighborhood change, and will learn how to
project and forecast future trends. We will learn how to describe community characteristics with small area census data, work with local administrative data, and will learn how to design primary data collection strategies to fill in gaps in knowledge gained through exploration and analysis.

By the end of this course, we will:

1. Become familiar with common sources of information used to describe neighborhoods and
neighborhood characteristics;
2. Learn how to use R, RStudio, and Github in service of creating reproducible analysis of
neighborhood-level information;
3. Learn how to use the information to tell compelling stories for deliberation and decisionmaking;
4. Demonstrate your application of skills by preparing a virtual portfolio of your work.

# Course Format and Expectations
We will learn together using a combination of direct instruction, lab sessions, and tutorials. We will use reading and reflection to help us contextualize our understanding of
neighborhoods, however, our focus will be on learning by doing. 
Please plan on being able to work on a computer during most of our course sessions (including optional in-person course sessions). Given our focus on learning by doing, I am expecting a polished end product by the end of the semester. I expect that your final work in this class will be of “A” quality, meaning that it is ready for dissemination (see the Assignments, Grading, and Attendance section below for more detail on grading criteria).

# Prerequisites
UP 494-AG: Neighborhood Analysis has no prerequisites aside from upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level standing. 

- Students will benefit from some prior knowledge of urban planning concepts, and analytical techniques, although these can be learned along the way. 
- Students will also benefit from some prior knowledge working in R and RStudio, however, this is also not a course prerequisite. 
- The first few weeks of our class incorporate an accelerated schedule for learning R and RStudio to support your deeper learning of neighborhood analysis. Please plan your time accordingly. 

Please talk with me if you have any questions regarding whether this course is right for you.

# Assignments 

## Class Reflections
Due weekly throughout the semester.

## R Learner's Permit
A short test to demonstrate your mastery of core concepts of data manipulation using R and RStudio which we will build on throughout the remainder of the semester.

## Lab Notebooks
Over the course of the semester, you will work on a series of lab notebooks which ask you to apply what you've learned in class to new data and analysis questions.

## Term Assignment
You will independently apply the skills and principles of data analysis we learn  to produce a policy-relevant analysis. Your term assignment will have several deliverables which are spread throughout the semester:

- **Project Proposal:** You will develop a proposal that describes the analysis which you contract to complete by the end of the semester. Your proposal will include a statement regarding the motivation for your analysis, the information you plan to use, your analytical strategy, your anticipated outcomes, and information on the format of your final outputs.

- **Project Background:** You will prepare some general project background that includes a descriptive analysis 
- **Completed Project:** You will synthesize elements of your project proposal, project background, and additional analysis into a final project that includes analysis and interpretation.

- **Project Presentation:** Graduate students are required to include a 10-minute presentation on their final project which will be given during one of our final course sessions as part of their grading contract. Undergraduate students are not required to complete a final project presentation, but may contract to do so for a higher grade (see more information on our approach to grades this semester below).

## Contract Extensions

We will be using a contract grading system this semester (more details on the in a moment). You will design your evaluation contract based upon your learning goals. Some of you may want to propose extensions to your contract in order to contract for a higher grade. Here are some ideas for contract extensions you may wish to proposal (you can of course develop and propose other ideas as well):

- **Develop a Neighborhood Analysis Portfolio::** You could contract to create a portfolio of your analysis work over the course of the semester. This portfolio would include polished output suitable to share with a prospective employer or internship site.

- **Extend a Lab Notebook:** Over the course of the semester, you'll be working through several lab notebooks that walk you through techniques and approaches to different modes of neighborhood analysis. You could propose extending the analysis you are asked to do in these notebooks beyond what is asked of you in the lab. This might include a more expanded analysis of the data, or the application of the lab concepts to a different context or data of your choosing. Extending a lab notebook should involve producing some type of formalized output that is polished and ready for review..

- **Write an Op Ed:** Your final project asks you to perform a neighborhood-level analysis of your own design that is policy-relevant to a particular place. Based upon what your analysis reveals, you may have policy-relevant conclusions that it would be useful to share with a public audience. You can write an OpEd targeting a local newspaper that articulates a persuasive public argument and that draws substantively from your analysis. Good resources for this include [The OpEd Project](https://www.theopedproject.org), the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/opinion/tips-for-aspiring-op-ed-writers.html), [Goh and Bourne](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008187), and [Scientific American](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/if-you-want-to-explain-your-science-to-the-public-heres-some-advice/).

- **Develop a proposed extension to your final project:** It is likely that your final project will produce some insightful information drawing upon your analysis of existing data. It is also likely that through the process of conducting your analysis that you will reach the limits of what the data can tell you, and that you will have additional questions which you would like to answer. You can develop a proposed set of next steps based upon what you would do to continue to develop the analysis which you have conducted. This might include gaining insight from other sources of secondary data, applying other types of analytical techniques, or developing a plan for primary data collection to supplement your existing analysis.

Again, these are just a few suggested ways in which you can contract to extend your grade. Please spend some time early in the class thinking about what your goals are this semester, and what work (in addition to our base expectations) might be part of this. Please be prepared to share these ideas when we meet one-on-one early in the semester to review your contract proposal. Of course we can also talk through some of these ideas in our class sessions during the first few weeks of class.

# Evaluation and Grading Contract

Alongside our learning of techniques and perspectives on working with data, a primary goal of this class is to learn to think critically about the ways in which those data and our analysis embody *power* and exist within power relationships. One implicit goal of our learning this semester is to envision and embody through our work alternative ways to share power and create meaning. We will consequently share power and authority for evaluation of work by establishing individualized grading contracts which will allow you to set many of the terms upon which your work is evaluated this semester. You will then be held accountable to the standards we agree upon.

We are using this approach for several reasons:

1.    As aforementioned, implementing a contract-based assessment approach mirrors some of the broader course goals regarding our understanding and practice around the power of data, particularly with regards to public deliberation, decision-making, and governance. Dealing differently with power around evaluation in our classroom mirrors potential differences in how we deal with power and power relationships around other processes we participate in, including professional practice.
2.    A unitary assessment of performance in a 400-level class is not likely to serve students well. This class is open to advanced undergraduate students, Masters students, and Doctoral students, some pursuing degrees in planning and others who are not. Given the heterogeneity of our learning community and your individual motivations for taking this class, contracts will allow us to assess your work against your own expectations and evaluation of learning.
3.    There is increasing evidence, particularly in higher education settings, that traditional unitary grading measures often hamper individual learning, and have the potential to be biased towards certain types of students. When given more control and ownership over the terms of their evaluation, students are more likely to embrace the challenges presented to them within the classroom, and are more likely to take ownership of their work (see, for instance [Elbow](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=eng_faculty_pubs) and [Inoue](https://wac.colostate.edu/books/perspectives/labor/)).
4.    We are attempting to learn together through a set of extremely challenging times. The impact of COVID-19 on your lives and your learning should not be discounted. The impact is also very individualized to each of your situations. A unitary grading standard would typically be strained to account for your circumstances.

## Baseline Standards

Each of you is expected to meet the following baseline standards. By doing so, you will earn a grade of "B". 

- **Attend class regularly:** Show up for course sessions before or on time, be absent from no more than three course sessions over the course of the semester. If you are unable to be present due to illness or other extenuating circumstances, please let me know *before* the course session in which you are absent, and I will consider excusing the absent.  
- **Participate actively:** In addition to showing up to class sessions on time, you are expected to make thoughtful and informed contributions to our class community. This includes coming to class prepared and having completed readings, reflections and assignments. This also includes thoughtful engagement with course material, asking and responding to questions, and helping other students familiarize course concepts.
- **Be visible:** Due to necessary COVID-19 safety precautions, most of our synchronous course sessions will be offered via Zoom. Active participation in the discussion portions of our course ask that you engage with your camera on.
- **Submit work on time:** There will be three grade reconciliation periods in the semester. Each assignment will be due within a reconciliation period. Each assignment will also list a *recommended* due date. You are responsible for submitting your work by the end of the grade reconciliation period. Work due within a reconciliation period that is submitted within 48 hours of the conclusion of that period will be counted as *late*. Work due within a reconciliation period submitted more than 48 hours will be considered *ignored*.

## Expectation Summary
```{r grade_expectations, results="asis", echo=FALSE}
g_points <- tribble(
  ~points, ~ grade, ~ absences, ~late_a, ~missed_a, ~ignored_a,
  "90-100", "A", 3, 1, 0, 0,
  "80-89", "B", 3, 1, 0, 0,
  "70-79", "C", 4, 2, 1, 1,
  "60-69", "D", 5, 3, 2, 1,
  "0-59", "F", 6, 4, 3, 1
)

g_points %>%
  pandoc.table(justify = "llllll",
               col.names = c("Percent", "Grade", "Absences", "Late", "Missed", "Ignored"))
```

The baseline contract standard in the class is a "B". The above summary helps you understand how deviations from that baseline standard may be reflected in your own contract proposals. You can contract for a grade between C and A (C, C+, B-, B, B+, A-, A). The above table may help you to propose accountability expectations that deviate from our baseline expectations.

- **Absences** indicate the number of times you can be absent from class. Additional excused absences may be allowed due to documented extenuating circumstances.
- **Late Assignments** are assignments submitted within 48 hours of the grade reconciliation period within which they are due.
- **Missed Assignments** are assignments submitted more than 48 hours after the grade reconciliation period within which they are due. Note that missing assignments is considered a more serious breach of your contract when compared to late assignments.
- **Ignored Assignments** are assignments that are not submitted by the end of the semester. Ignored assignments are a more serious breach of contract than missed assignments as they reflect contracted work which you have not completed.

Please note that assessment of these contracted standards will be binary (yes / no) in nature are are based upon *what you do*. The default contracted "B" grade does not include any direct assessment of the quality of your work.  As you design your learning contract, you can use the above table to help you propose expectations in line with the final grade you wish to contract to received.

## Preparing your Contract
Our grading system this semester focuses on capturing the consistent application of your labor towards our course goals. If you consistently submit your work as contracted, you'll receive a "B" at the end of the semester. Consequently, to contract for a higher (or lower) grade, you may commit yourself to applying more (or less) labor in support of course goals when you design your contract.

Please use the following [contract template](documents/UP494 S21 Learning Contract.docx) to construct your proposed learning contract for the semester.

# Honor Code
The [Illinois Student Code](https://studentcode.illinois.edu) states: “It is the responsibility of the student to refrain from infractions of academic integrity, from conduct that may lead to suspicion of such infractions, and from conduct that aids others in such infractions.” Note that you are subject to the Honor Code, as well as procedures for addressing violations to the Code, regardless of whether you have read it and understand it. According to the Code, “ignorance is no excuse.”

To meet this standard in this course, note the following: in written work, all ideas (as well as data or other information) that are not your own must be cited. Note that ideas that require citation may not have been published or written down anywhere. While you are free—and indeed encouraged—to discuss assignments with your peers, all of your analysis, and writing should be your own. The consequence for violating these expectations may include receiving no credit for the assignment in question, and may include automatic failure of the course.

Put simply, don't cheat and give credit where credit is due.

# Learning Environment and Support

**Learning Environment:** The [Department of Urban and Regional Planning](https://urban.illinois.edu) is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is rooted in the goals and responsibilities of professional planners. By enrolling in a class offered by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, students agree to be responsible for maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect in all activities, including lectures, discussions, labs, projects, and extracurricular opportunities. See [Student Code Article 1-Student Rights and Responsibilities, Part 1](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part1/1-101/). Student Rights: §1-102.

**Counseling Center and Student Support:** Throughout the semester, you may need assistance coping with emotional, interpersonal, or academic concerns. The [Counseling Center](http://www.counselingcenter.illinois.edu) provides both short-term and longer-term counseling to students who may need assistance. Please do not hesitate to reach out or request assistance.

## Your Wellness

### Learning R and your Wellness

Whether you have prior experience working in R or not, you *will* face challenges related to working with the software this semester. That's a given, and is an expected part of learning in this class. Part of the goal is to teach you how to understand the intentionality behind the software so that you can anticipate where errors are likely to occur.

The only way to do this, is to encounter errors -  and there will be many. You are learning a new language, it's grammar, and its application. While this will be frustrating at times, there is a major payoff in the capacity you will gain both in analytic skills, but also in problem-solving. This payoff will come slowly over time - do not expect it to come easily.

You are not alone in this struggle. In addition to your classmates and others who are going through the same thing, there is a large R user community, and lots of existing documentation and troubleshooting on sites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com). Any problem you will encounter has likely been encountered and addressed before. When I run into an error, after an initial check for simple issues like closing parentheses and spelling errors, I copy and paste error codes directly into a web search to see how others have dealt with similar problems. I encourage you to do the same.

You got this, and there will be a payoff, so long as you use the tools consistently - I *promise*!

### Covid and your Wellness
These are not normal times, and it would be irresponsible to expect that teaching and learning would occur "normally" given the circumstances. We are teaching and learning under emergency circumstances amidst a global pandemic. I understand that you have lives outside of this class and more generally outside of your studies, and I understand that especially given the current circumstances that things will come up that take your attention away from our coursework.

While I will expect a lot of you this semester, I am also willing to be flexible. I have designed course deliverable dates with this flexibility in mind, and will devote some of our class time to checking in about class progress. In return, I need you to communicate with me, either during those course sessions or individually. You can schedule an appointment with me at your convenience via my [Calendly page](https://calendly.com/agreen4/neighborhood-analysis). I promise to listen, to be a resource, and to help in any way that I can - if I can't help you, I will find someone who can.
